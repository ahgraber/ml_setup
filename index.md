# ml_setup
#### documenting initial setup/installs for ML projects
last updated Jan 2019

### Current hardware:
* CPU: Intel i7-8700k (OC'd to 5.1 ghz all core)
* RAM: 64 GB DDR4-2666
* GPU: MSI Radeon Vega 56 Air Boost (OC'd & Undervolted)
* Storage: 256 GB+ NVMe SSD; 2 TB HDD

I've tried to document my setup for both macOS and Windows; that said, Windows is kind of hacky - you can get it to work for some things, and then you have to go around the world a different way for something else... WSL helps with this, but if you need Windows, you might try docker or dual-booting Linux.

### Documented Separately - recommended order:
1. Optional - [Optimized linear algebra libraries, etc](optimized.md)
2. [Other random support](other.md)
3. [Python, supporting libraries, jupyter notebook / spyder](python.md)
4. [R, supporting packages, RStudio](r.md)
5. Optional - [.bash_profile for mac](bash_profile.md)
6. Optional - [Octave/Matlab](octave.md)
